# ThreatFlux

## Introduction

ThreatFlux is an open-source security group focused on developing free, community-driven software tools for cybersecurity. Its mission is to provide accessible solutions for threat detection, analysis, and data security, with an emphasis on modern techniques such as AI integration ([GitHub - ThreatFlux/YaraFlux: A yara based MCP Server](https://github.com/ThreatFlux/YaraFlux#:~:text=YaraFlux%20MCP%20Server%20enables%20AI,analysis%20through%20a%20modular%20architecture)) ([GitHub - ThreatFlux/searchyaml: A new database](https://github.com/ThreatFlux/searchyaml#:~:text=SearchYAML)). All projects are released under permissive licenses (primarily the MIT License) to encourage wide use and collaboration ([ThreatFlux repositories · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/ThreatFlux/repositories#:~:text=A%20new%20database)). By dedicating efforts to free and open software, ThreatFlux aims to empower researchers and practitioners with practical and innovative security tools.

## Repositories

Some of ThreatFlux’s notable open-source projects include:

- **[YaraFlux](https://github.com/ThreatFlux/YaraFlux)** – A YARA-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with AI assistants. YaraFlux allows large language models (LLMs) to analyze files using YARA rules, enabling automated malware scanning and threat analysis via a standardized interface ([GitHub - ThreatFlux/YaraFlux: A yara based MCP Server](https://github.com/ThreatFlux/YaraFlux#:~:text=A%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20,analyze%20files%20with%20YARA%20rules)). *(MIT License; Python)*

- **[SearchYAML](https://github.com/ThreatFlux/searchyaml)** – A high-performance, memory-mapped key–value store with built-in search capabilities. SearchYAML bridges traditional databases and modern AI/ML workloads by combining efficient CRUD operations with native text and vector search on YAML data ([GitHub - ThreatFlux/searchyaml: A new database](https://github.com/ThreatFlux/searchyaml#:~:text=SearchYAML)). *(MIT License; Go)*

- **[Cryptum-Go](https://github.com/ThreatFlux/cryptum-go)** – A robust Go implementation of the “Cryptum” encryption framework. Cryptum-Go provides secure hybrid encryption using RSA and AES (4096-bit RSA for key exchange and AES-GCM for data) and is cross-compatible with the Python version of Cryptum ([GitHub - ThreatFlux/cryptum-go: A Go implementation of the Cryptum encryption framework, providing secure hybrid encryption capabilities using RSA and AES. This project is compatible with the Python cryptum library while leveraging Go's strong cryptographic primitives.](https://github.com/ThreatFlux/cryptum-go#:~:text=A%20robust%20Go%20implementation%20of,leveraging%20Go%27s%20strong%20cryptographic%20primitives)). It offers both a CLI tool and a library for developers, supporting features like key generation and end-to-end encrypted data storage. *(MIT License; Go)*

- **[YARA-Rules](https://github.com/ThreatFlux/Yara-Rules)** – A repository of curated YARA rules for malware detection and threat actor tracking. The rules are organized by category (threat groups, malware families, known good files, etc.) for easy navigation and maintenance ([GitHub - ThreatFlux/Yara-Rules: Yara-Rules](https://github.com/ThreatFlux/Yara-Rules#:~:text=YARA%20Rules%20Repository)). Security analysts can use this collection to quickly identify malicious files or confirm benign files in investigations. *(MIT License; YARA)*

- **[BookManager](https://github.com/ThreatFlux/BookManager)** – A comprehensive command-line tool for managing book writing projects. BookManager can scan and organize manuscript directories, analyze content (word counts, term frequency, TODOs), and compile outputs in multiple formats (DOCX, EPUB, PDF) ([GitHub - ThreatFlux/BookManager: A book manager](https://github.com/ThreatFlux/BookManager#:~:text=A%20comprehensive%20command,manuscript%20compilations%20in%20multiple%20formats)). While not strictly a security tool, it reflects ThreatFlux’s commitment to open-source utility software. *(MIT License; Python)*

## Contributing

ThreatFlux welcomes contributions from the community. If you’d like to get involved in improving these projects or adding new ones, you can follow the standard GitHub workflow ([Yara-Rules/CONTRIBUTING.md at main · ThreatFlux/Yara-Rules · GitHub](https://github.com/ThreatFlux/Yara-Rules/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#:~:text=How%20to%20Contribute)):

1. **Fork the repository** you want to contribute to, creating your own copy under your GitHub account.  
2. **Create a new branch** for your changes (e.g. `feature/new-rule` or `fix/issue-123`).  
3. **Implement your changes** – whether it’s new features, bug fixes, or new YARA rules – adhering to any coding guidelines or style guides noted in the project.  
4. **Test your contribution** thoroughly (for YARA rules, test against both malicious and benign samples; for code, run included test suites if available).  
5. **Submit a pull request** to the original repository, with a clear description of your changes. The maintainers will review your PR and merge it if it meets the project’s requirements.

Before contributing, it’s a good idea to check if the repository has a `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide (for example, the YARA-Rules repo provides detailed guidelines on rule format and placement). You can also open an issue to discuss major changes or to report bugs and request features. Participating in discussions and reviewing open issues/Pull Requests are additional ways to contribute to the ThreatFlux community.
